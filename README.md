-   [x] Consider an example of book shop which sells books and video tapes. These two classes are inherited from base class called media. The media class has command data members such as title and publication. The book class has data members for storing number of pages in a book and tape class has playing time in a tape. Each class will have member functions such as read () and show (). In the base class, these members have to be defined as virtual - [x] WAP to models the class hierarchy for book shop and processes objects of these classes using pointers to base class.
